For Cheng Han's (Reading University, 2020) MSc project.

Requirements, these python packages need to be installed: pcse, netcdf4, matplotlib

run_wofost.py can be run to write data from netcdf files into cabo weather files
and then to run the PCSE WOFOST crop model itself. It prints final yeild and plots
two WOFOST outputs to check it is running properly.

PCSE_WOFOST_helpers.py contains functions that are imported in run_wofost.py

Hengshui.soil, maize.yaml and timer_china_maize.amgt contain soil, crop and crop timing
information used by PCSE WOFOST.
